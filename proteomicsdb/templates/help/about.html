        A proteomics-computational approach to characterizing IFI16-dependent immune signaling </h2>

    <p class = "body" style = "text-align: justify">
        Over the years, our lab has performed many MS proteomics experiments in the
      context of herpesvirus infection, characterizing PPIs, PTMs, and whole proteome abundance
      (Jean Beltran et al., 2016; Crow & Cristea, 2017; Murray et al., 2018; Lum et al., 2018;
      Hashimoto et al., 2020). Furthermore, we have published several IFI16 immuno-precipitation
      (IP)-MS datasets obtained from a variety of conditions including virus strains (i.e. mock, WT, or
      RF HSV-1 infection), timepoints, cell types, and IFI16 mutants (Li et al., 2012; Diner, Li, et al.,
      2015; Diner, Lum, Javitt, et al., 2015; Diner et al., 2016; Lum et al., 2019). The repository I build
      will begin by analyzing this wealth of data generated by our lab to generate an integrative
      understanding of protein dynamics during viral infection. The integration of different types of
      data (proteome, interactome, and PTMs) will link PPI observations with PTMs, protein
        abundance alterations, etc.
