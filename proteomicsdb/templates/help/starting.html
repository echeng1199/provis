    <h1>Starting Point </h1>
<hr>

<p>
    To specify your desired starting point of the analysis you have to use the input form at the STRING start page.

    <li> Protein by name </li>
    <li> Protein by sequence </li>
    <li> Multiple proteins </li>
    <li> Multiple sequences </li>
    <li> Organisms </li>
    <li> Protein families (COGs) </li>
    <li> Examples </li>
    <li> Random entry </li>

</p>

<p>
    You can search STRING by single protein name, multiple names or by amino acid sequence (in any format).
    There are also example inputs and a random input generator which will randomly select a protein with at least
    4 predicted links at medium confidence or better. There is a organism entry to see if your species of interest
    is available. There is the possibility to search by protein family rather than a protein in a single organism,
    by searching the COGs (clusters of orthologous groups). Commonly, you enter your protein of interest by supplying
    its name or identifier. The organism can be selected by clicking on the arrow or directly typing the name inside
    the relative input field (an autocompletion mechanism will appear to help you). General names that group more than
    one organism (e.g. "Mammals", "Chordata") can also be used.
